  duration:  Sep, 2020 &mdash; Dec 2020
  summary: |
    I analyzed and defined EDI requirements for clients, especially for needs 
    and circumstances that are slightly unusual. I provided advice and education 
    to clients concerning EDI guidelines and capabilities as well as created 
    relevant data mapping documents. Collaboration with programmers and internal 
    staff to develop and test new or modified systems was critical to accomplishing 
    tasks efficiently and with less proneness to error.If your stint was shorter,
